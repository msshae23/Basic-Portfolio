I am originally from Kansas but had relocated to Dallas soon after my college graduation then ultimately to Cleveland,OH where I am currently learning to code! Baking, reading, and practicing Spanish are some of my favorite pasttimes. When I'm not doing those thingss I am researching flight information for my next trip to San Diego, California to visit my neices and nephew. I enjoy learning and implementing new things and I look forward to all that this coding bootcamp has to offer! If so inclined please feel free to further connect with me via social media!</p>
